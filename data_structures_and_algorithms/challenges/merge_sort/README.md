# Insertion Sort

Merge sort is a *divide-and-conquer* algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list. Merge sort divides input array in two halves, left and right, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. 

## Problem Domain

Create a function that takes in an array, sort it using merge sort algorithm


## Whiteboard:


<img src= '/assets/merging.PNG' style = 'display: block; margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto; width: 50%; '>
