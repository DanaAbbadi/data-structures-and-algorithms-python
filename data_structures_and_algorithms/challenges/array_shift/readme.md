# Array Shift

This program takes an array and a number from the user and then inserts the number at the center of the array

## Challenge

Inserting the number at the center without using built in functions

## Approach & Efficiency

To reach the middle of the array, we compare the given number with the valyes inside the array. Then we insert the number, and break outside the loop.
