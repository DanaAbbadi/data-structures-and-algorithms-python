# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is the sorting mechanism where the sorted array is built having one item at a time. The array elements are compared with each other sequentially and then arranged simultaneously in some particular order. The analogy can be understood from the style we arrange a deck of cards. This sort works on the principle of inserting an element at a particular position, hence the name Insertion Sort.

## Problem Domain

Create a function that takes in an array, sort it using insertion sort mechanism then return it


## Whiteboard:


<img src= '/assets/insertion.PNG' style = 'display: block; margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto; width: 50%; '>
