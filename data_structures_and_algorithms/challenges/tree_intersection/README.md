## Problem Domain

Create a function, that takes two binary trees as inputs and return their insertion. The insertion occurs when two nodes have the same value and location in both trees.

## Algorithm

1. Check if one or both of the trees are empty.
2. Define a closure function, to loop through the tree.
3. Each time the function will check if the current nodes are equal, if they are, they will be added to the list.
4. Keep calling the closure function till the end of the trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time Big O(n) where n is size of the biggest tree. 

Space Big O(n).
