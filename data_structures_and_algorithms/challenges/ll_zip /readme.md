# Zipped Lists

## problem Domian

Zip two linked lists.

## Approach & Efficiency

Zipped two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

Example:

    List1 = head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X
    List2 = head -> [5] -> [9] -> [4] -> X
    zipped_List = head -> [1] -> [5] -> [3] -> [9] -> [2] -> [4] -> X
