# Trees


## Description

Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children.

Binary Search tree exhibits a special behavior. A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

 * Depth First
    
 * Breadth First

In this challenge, I created a binary tree with the ability to traverse the tree, I followed breadth first approach. 

## Whiteboard:

##### Breadth First method
