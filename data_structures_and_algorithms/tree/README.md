# Trees


## Description

Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children.

Binary Search tree exhibits a special behavior. A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

 * Depth First
    There are three methods for depth first traversal:

    - Pre-order: root >> left >> right
    - In-order: left >> root >> right
    - Post-order: left >> right >> root
  

 * Breadth First

In this challenge, I created a binary tree with the ability to add and search a node in the tree. To traverse the tree, I followed depth first approach.
