# Hashtables

A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1).

## Challenge

The challenge with Hashtables is how to handle collisions, where different keys will be hashed to result in the same location.

One way to solve this is by using **chaining**. Chaining is the idea of formatting linked lists on all collisions. If you want to retrieve that specific information youâ€™d have to traverse the linked list. For example, in the chart bellow John Smith and Sandra Dee are indeed colliding, but using chaining we can retrieve the right data.

## Implementation

##### The Hashtable is implemented with the following methods:

* **hash:** takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
* **add:** takes in both the key and value. This method hashes the key, and adds the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* **get:** takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* **contains:** takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

## Testing

The Hashtable implementation passes the following tests:

1. Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
2. Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
3. Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
4. Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
5. Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
6. Successfully hash a key to an in-range value
